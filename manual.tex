\part{Gettings started}

\section{Start here }

\subsection{Power}

The first thing to do is power the pedal. It's 9V center negative
and requires at least 500mA. After that it'll start up. Start up time
is currently a bit long, so don't panic if nothing is happening for
a few seconds.

Once Digit / Beebo has started up we're at the main screen, with the
default preset (the first one in your set list) loaded. From here
we can add modules, change the settings of existing modules, connect
modules or load a preset. This leads to the question, what is a module?
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_23_18-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

\subsection{Modules}

Modules are the basic blocks you connect. Think of them as individual
effect pedals on a pedal board that you place and connect. There are
some modules that process audio, and some modules that you can use
to control other modules. The ability to control modules is the powerful
modular / eurorack style workflow that differentiates Digit / Beebo
from many other systems.

\subsection{Add a module}

To start, we'll add a delay to the default preset. To do this, tap
plus and choose delay. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_24_12-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

The new delay will appear on the screen and you can now drag it to
a comfortable spot. You can drag any module at any time to move it.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_24_43-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

To start I recommend tapping the help button (the ? mark) which will
turn on the extra help labels. Remember that single modules can be
very powerful, so start with a small number of them and understand
them before adding more. It'll be much easier to work out what is
going on. The standard delay module has many features compared to
standalone delay pedals!

\subsection{Connect a module}

You'll now want to connect up the delay. Hold input 1, then with another
finger tap the delay you've added. This multi touch stuff is really
much easier to see on a video. Any recent video should show this connection
style.

This is just the same as connecting up pedals on a pedal board, but
you can split and merge signals easily. You choose a source and then
a module to connect to. So now hold delay 1 and then tap output 1
to connect them. If you're connecting things with multiple inputs
or outputs a screen will appear where you can select which to use. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_25_35-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

\subsection{Change settings }

We can now change the settings of the delay. Tap on it to get up the
controls. Many modules have extra controls in the side menus.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_26_07-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

\subsection{Knobs}

Once you touch any slider to change it, it automatically maps to the
knobs. The right knob changes the value a lot (coarse) and the left
by a little (fine).

\subsection{Presets}

To save or load a preset tap the floppy disk icon. You'll also see
a set list option. This is what order you move through the presets
in your set list when pressing both center and right or center and
left foot switches together.

\subsection{Toggle Effects with Foot switches}

By default, the right most foot switch is bypass and the two others
don't do anything. Foot switches can act as tempo sources or as control
sources. 

If you just want to enable or disable something with a foot switch,
hold the module you want to control and the press the physical foot
switch you want to use. A small letter in a circle will appear showing
the foot switch you choose to use. You can remap all 3 foot switches
like this. You can also assign a single foot switch to multiple modules. 

If you want to toggle between to delays for example, set one to disabled
then assign both to the same foot switch, they will now toggle which
is active.

\subsection{Foot Switches as CV or Tempo Sources}

If you want to control a specific parameter with a foot switch, tap
add (+) and then select foot switch A or B. A is the left one, B is
the center, C is the right.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_33_59-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

Now tap the foot switch module you've added and then tap connect.
You can now connect it to things you want to control. There are two
outputs, the tap tempo and its value. Value is if it's up or pressed
down. To connect tap tempo from the foot switch, hold the foot swtich
and tap the delay. Then choose the BPM out.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_34_26-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_35_03-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

\subsection{LFO / control signals}

As you saw with foot switches, one module can control another. If
we now add a low frequency oscillator (LFO) we can use that to control
other settings on the delay. Add the LFO then hold it and tap the
delay. Then choose warp in the screen that appears.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_34_43-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

Control signals are coloured green.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_36_08-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

The effect will be quite strong, so if we want to reduce we can tap
on the LFO and reduce the level. A uni polar LFO will only got from
0-1 (positive) but if you set that to zero it'll go negative and positive.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_55_25-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

We can also add other modules in between such as the attenuverter
that act on the control signals. We can invert the phase or reduce
the level with this as well, in case we want the same LFO to control
two different things at different amounts or phase.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_36_50-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

The attenuverter attenuates and/or inverts a signal. It has two inputs
which can be either be controlled by the sliders or by a control input.
You can attenuate / invert one control signal with another allowing
you ring mod / AM style control possibilities.

\subsection{Firmware update}

If you have a very early Digit and currently have version 1.something
(eg 1.7) firmware installed (check in the setting menu) please contact
me before updating. 

For Beebo or January 2020 or later versions of Digit, please grab
the packages in the 'upgrade\_from\_2' folder from here and put them
on a usb flash drive and click upgrade. It should be very quick. It'll
restart itself. The packages need to all be on the USB drive and not
in a zip. The current packages are frontend, modules, ingen and extra-content.
If you've updated recently and know that one file hasn't changed then
you don't need to include it on the USB flash drive next update and
it'll update a little faster.

The USB flash drive must be formatted FAT32 and have one partition
on it. If the update fails, please try pressing export presets in
the settings screen. If that also fails then the USB flash drive is
unreadable, either due to having no partitions (partitonless drive)
or being the wrong format. Please contact me for help. Please use
a normal USB flash drive and not an external hard drive. The cheap
NXT ones from Staples work well. All Sandisk ones tested also worked
well. Verbatim ones tested have failed.

\subsection{Inputs as effects loops}

You can use the input / outputs of Digit as effect loops. For example,
physically connect output 3 to an external phaser pedal, then connect
the output of the phaser to input 3. Then on Digit, connect a delay
to output 3, and then connect input 3 directly to output 1. The repeats
of that delay will now be running through the phaser. Be careful not
to create feedback paths, or route dry in parallel where some signal
goes through external pedals. The extra latency / phase difference
between the direct and effected signals can cause weird effects. So
it’s always safer just to effect things like delays / reverb tails.

\subsection{Rhythmic delays}

Tap a delay to see the details.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_42_52-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

There are two modes. If you choose beats you can set a BPM and then
choose a subdivision in the right drop down menu. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_43_25-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

You can also set time in milliseconds, tap the time button and then
you can type in a number if you press the milliseconds field, or just
slide the slider to an approximate position.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\string"manual_images/design/2020-06-26 17_43_36-Digit 2\string".png}
\par\end{center}

The amount of milliseconds won't follow your tap tempo, so if you
have a tempo input plugged in the times here won't be relevant and
you should use the beat setting.

\subsection{Import reverbs / cabs}

To import new cab or reverb IRs onto Digit, copy them onto a USB flash
drive in folders called reverbs and cabs for each. Then go to settings
and tap Copy IRs. The files must be 48 kHz wavs. 

\subsection{Import / Export Presets}

Press the floppy disk icon to get to the preset screen. Then press
export preset where it'll ask you if you want to export the current
preset or all presets.

\section{MIDI}

\subsection{Changing Presets}

To change a preset with a program message, press the floppy disk icon
to get to the preset screen. Tap set list and add preset here. The
number next to them is what program change message you should send
to change to that preset. This is also the order the foot switch pairs
with D and E will step through them. 

\subsection{CC Controls}

To learn a control, press the MIDI icon next to the slider. It will
then pulse until it detects a CC.
